        <h4>The Greenwich Tea Burning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At this point, people were boycotting the British imports of tea (This is after the Boston Tea party on December 16, 1773), and the First Continental Congress had found out that a British Sympathizer by the name of Daniel Bowen was hiding tea for the British.</li>
            <li>The continental congress, now presumably the governing factor of the colonies, was determining what to do with this information, but were interrupted as members of the congress decided to take matters into their own hands, burning the tea that Bowen hid.</li>
            <li>The individuals responsible were taken for criminal charges, but later absolved due to the public state.</li>

    <p>After winning these wars, it boosted the sentiments of the public and the militia, invigorating patriotic spirit (<a href = "https://www.njstatelib.org/research-sources-primary-secondary-and-tertiary/#:~:text=In%201778%20General%20George%20Washington,for%20other%20researchers%20to%20use.">Washington Letter to the Public</a>, Primary), and caused a rallying effect for remaining troops and new troops to continue fighting whilst allowing backing from the French to be secured by that of American diplomats.<br><br>After the patriots had successfully acquired foreign aid through the help of international diplomats and foreign entanglements, they were able to win the battle of Monmouth with the aid of the French (mostly voluntary officers and individuals such as Lafayette) on the 28 of June, 1778.
