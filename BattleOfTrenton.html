        <h1>Battle Of Trenton</h1>
        <p>On December 26, 2025, George Washington surprised the Hessian forces with a surprise attack on December 25 well into December 26, 1776, changing the tide of the Battle as he crossed the Delaware river successfully with 2400 men and attacked the Hessian forces on a day which they had not expected; Christmas. This battle was known as the battle of Trenton, due to the Battles location in that of Trenton, as the Hessians took base there.</p>
