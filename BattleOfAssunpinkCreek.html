        <h1>The Battle of Assunpink Creek, or The Second Battle of Trenton</h1>
        <p>The battle of Assunpink Creek in Trenton, New Jersey was an inspirational one waged by the troops. At this point in time, on January 2, 1777, the troops releasement dates from the military were approaching soon, and many of the troops were exhausted and tired from this long waged war. Despite this, Washington felt that American victory was in range given the direction of the last battle, and to this, he petitioned his men to stay just a bit longer past their enlistment dates, sharing the hope he felt towards victory. His men, at first reluctantly responded, but at the end they were so moved by Washington’s words that a great majority of them had decided to stay and fight. For this very reason and the American’s being a unified front, they were successfully able to slow down and disadvantage the British, who withdrew in the hopes of gaining the upperhand once more in the morning. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Assunpink_Creek">Click here to see Wikapedia's description of the battle.</a></p>
